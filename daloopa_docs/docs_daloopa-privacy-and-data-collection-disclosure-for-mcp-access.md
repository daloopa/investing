# Privacy and Data Collection Disclosure for MCP Access

# Privacy and Data Collection Disclosure for MCP Access

This Privacy and Data Collection Disclosure outlines how Daloopa handles user data in connection with our Model Context Protocol (MCP) services and integrations, including through platforms such as Claude, OpenAI APIs, or any LLM Chatbot or API service that follows MCP Standard Protocol.

### 

Data Collected

Daloopa collects minimal user data, strictly necessary for providing MCP access and monitoring usage:

  * Access Logs: We log user-level activity including authentication events, accessed tickers, and usage frequency.
  * Account Metadata: We may collect a user's name, email address, and affiliated organization (if applicable).
  * Daloopa does not systematically collect or store user prompts, inputs, or queries. We also do not have access to, and therefore do not store, any LLM-generated outputs (e.g., chatbot responses) resulting from interactions with our MCP server.



### 

Security and Infrastructure

  * The Daloopa MCP server implements the [MCP OAuth Specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization) to ensure secure, credentialed access.
  * MCP access is strictly read-only. Third parties cannot write to, upload to, or modify any Daloopa data via the protocol.
  * All data transmissions are encrypted in transit. Internal access is restricted, monitored, and subject to audit controls.



### 

Third-Party Sharing

  * Daloopa does not sell, share, or distribute any collected user data or access logs to third parties.
  * All data stays within Daloopa’s secure infrastructure and is used solely for operational, compliance, access monitoring, and internal analytical purposes.



### 

Data Retention

  * We retain access logs (e.g., login activity, ticker usage) only as necessary for compliance and internal analytics.
  * No long-term retention of user prompts or LLM outputs occurs, as they are never stored.



### 

Transparency and Branding

  * All users accessing Daloopa data via Claude, OpenAI APIs, or similar interfaces are made aware of the integration with Daloopa services.
  * No white-labeling is permitted. Daloopa branding and source attribution remain transparent throughout the user experience.
