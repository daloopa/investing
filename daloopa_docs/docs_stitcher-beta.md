# Stitcher

Automated document time series

## 

Read the same text / table across multiple documents

The purpose of Stitcher is to take snippets of the same concept over documents across time, and put them on a single pane that can be easily read. This will enable you to read around any concept over time in the source documents, without having to open multiple tabs.

**We stitch the sentence / paragraph / table for one concept, across the documents over time.**
