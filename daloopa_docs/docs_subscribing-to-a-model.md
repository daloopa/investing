# Subscribing to a Model

Engaging email alerts and finding new data disclosures

## 

Subscribe Button

You have unlimited access to all our models, but we don't want to alert to you every single update in our database, only those you care about.

All models need to be "subscribed" to before downloading.

Once you are subscribed to a model, you will receive an email alert informing you when a model has been updated. In that email, we will highlight any new data that we found in that quarter. When you download the new model, you will notice that the new data will be highlighted in yellow.

## 

Updating Your Own Model

Our Updater does not add new rows for you, so as to preserve the integrity of your model. When a model has new data, we will inform you of the new data in your email alert, so please copy the data into your own model as you see fit.

  


## 

Frequency of Email Alerts

Often you will find yourself receiving multiple update emails per quarter. This is because we update our models multiple times. Companies provide incremental disclosure documents over the course of a quarter, and we update our models as these documents are made available to the public.

For instance, the Press Release (8-K), 10-Q, and investor presentation are frequently disclosed at different times and days.
