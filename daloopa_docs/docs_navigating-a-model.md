Sources

10-K / 10-Q / Annual reports / Quarterly reports  
8-K (Press release / earnings release)  
Investor presentations

Data Collection Philosophy

We collect data as-is from company-reported filings. We do not edit or alter in any way the data the company provides. For instance, if the company provides a detailed cash flow statement breakdown, we will collect every single item and present them in our Excel models.

All models are checked multiple times to ensure that not only is the data accurate, but also the data relationships are accurate.

> **We collect data found in tables, management discussions & analyses, footnotes, other texts, charts, and graphs!**

Daloopa aims to provide you with the most comprehensive coverage of data there has ever been for public companies. Experience a volume of disclosed data never before seen.

Often you will find that our data is more than you will need. As a result, we made it so that deleting data will not impact updating or usability of our models. Feel free to remove whatever you don't need by simply deleting the rows.
