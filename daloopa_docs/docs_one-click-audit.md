Creating Emails with Sources

You can simply **copy + paste** any of the numbers into your email. The recipient will be able to click on that number on any device they are using to read the email to get access to the source.

**Never again be asked, "where did we get this number?"**

Truly Unique Audit Backend

Most other "audit" features are nothing more than opening a source document and performing a CTRL + F. It works... but only sometimes. The current industry standard is a human hardcode and an automated CTRL + F.

Daloopa's audit brings you to the exact location that a particular datapoint was obtained from. The same revenue number from the **segmental breakdown** section will not have the same source as the number from the **income statement**.
