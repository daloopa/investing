How to use Updater

![](https://files.readme.io/439d03b-image.png)

  


Provide the Updater simply with 2 fields - the Column in Excel you want data to be added to **(eg. AF)** and the Calendar Quarter of data you wish to update for in YYYYQ# format **(eg. 2022Q1)**.

  
  


> 📘
> 
> ### 
> 
> Update for years
> 
> Use the format **####FY (e.g. 2021FY)** in the updater to update for a fiscal year, instead of the quarter

  
  


## 

What gets updated, what doesn't?

The Updater will scan through your model for rows with Daloopa links. Once found, we will populate data in the column specified (eg. AF) with the data you requested for.

The Updater will override any data in that cell.

> Your "forecasted" data will be overridden with actual data. But your assumptions (Y/Y growth, % revenue, etc.) will be left alone.

## 

How do I update my existing models?

Simply run the [Retrofitter](doc:retrofitter) before you use the Updater. In less than 5 minutes, you should have your existing model updated!

  
  


## 

How quickly do you update?

We update our models in ~3 hours. We aim to improve this time every single quarter. In Q1 2021, we averaged 18 hours while in Q3 2021, we averaged 2.9 hours. We work relentlessly in the background to drive down the speed to update.

  
  


## 

Can you update models with more than 1 company's worth of data?

Yes! There is no limit to the number of companies worth of data we can update. So long as there is data, we will update it.

## 

How to handle unit and sign differences between my model and company disclosures?

Daloopa Retrofitter and Updater is smart enough to know when you are using different units and signs from the company's disclosure. This happens most often when a company discloses in thousands and you model in millions, or when a company provides a negative number for an expensive item, but you have it as a positive number in your model.

  
  


The following ~2min video will explain in detail how it works.
