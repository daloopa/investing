# Locating a Model

## 

Search Bar

The easiest way to find a company is to use the search bar. Type in a ticker, name, or industry group.

## 

Navigation Panel

Alternatively, make use of the navigation panel on the left. Here you can find all the models we have for each industry.

Each company is mapped to **only** 1 industry. Hence, there will be industries that might not have the company you wish to locate. Please use the search bar in this case. For instance, we group "Amazon" under "Internet and Direct Marketing Retail", and Walmart under "Food and Staples Retailing".
