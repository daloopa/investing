Industry model vs. Comp sheets

An industry model is a sheet that capture key industry KPIs that lets you track all the companies within an industry. These models track operational performance and helps you identify share win/loss, inventory buildup, margin deviation from the industry.

A comp sheet is usually a valuation sheet, where you can track each company's valuation over time.

With an industry model, you can **identify companies that are performing better or worse than their peers from an operational perspective** , with a comp sheet you are identifying valuation differences within a set of companies.

What are the key idea generation processes with industry models?

**1\. Tracking differences**  
With an industry model, you can find out when a company is doing something different from the rest of their peers. Is an auto manufacturer building up more inventory than sales? Is a restaurant experiencing growing same-store-sales when the rest are stagnating? These are questions you can answer in seconds with an industry model.

**2\. Speed**  
The first to identify companies that buckle an industry trend is able to generate outsized value. Historically, industry models take a long time to update. Daloopa's updating feature allows you to update industry models as the documents are released, and therefore arrive at decisions faster.
