# Resegmentations

At Daloopa, we extract data as-is from the source document when it is disclosed. We will display data from the point it is first disclosed, and we do not display restated numbers. You can click on the latest quarter to check for restatements using our audit tool.

We are currently working on a private beta with some customers to offer a restated version of our models. Speak to your customer success representative to learn more about this beta.

Often, new data will be disclosed at the point of the new quarter. Watch out for the update email where we will highlight the new rows added. When you download the new model, the added data will be highlighted in yellow.

> Sometimes a company will simply rename an item. A common one is changing from **"Revenue"** to **"Sales"** , in this case, Daloopa will not break out into a new item, since this was immaterial to the substance of the line-item.
