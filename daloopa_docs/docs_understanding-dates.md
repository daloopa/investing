We provide dates in 3 formats for each period.

**Calendar**  
Dates that capture the calendar period. If the mid-point of the period ends between Jan 1 and Mar 31, that period is the calendar period. For instance, if a company ends fiscal quarter Apr 30, the mid-point is Mar 15, which falls within Q1. Hence this quarter falls under the Q1 calendar.

**Fiscal**  
This is the actual fiscal period of the quarter.

> **Some companies will change the number of days in a period; instead of ending the quarter Mar 31, they end it on Apr 1 to add a day.** Use this as a guide to make sure you never miss such changes.

**Fiscal Date**  
This is the actual day the period ends, provided in **MM/DD/YYYY** format.  
If you need to find the actual number of days in a period, simply take the difference in Excel.
